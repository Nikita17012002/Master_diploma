# Transcription Factor Binding Site Generation Model from Protein Amino Acid Sequences

This repository contains tools for building a model that predicts transcription factor (TF) binding sites based on protein amino acid sequences. The model is trained on data capturing protein-DNA interactions and can be used to analyze regulatory elements in genomes.
